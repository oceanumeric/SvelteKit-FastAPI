# Learning Goals

Try to understand the following concepts:

-  What is a class?
- What is an object?
- What is a method?


## What is a class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It tells the computer how to create an object of that type. A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class.

__Class is a manufacturer of objects to do a particular job.__

We define this as a template.


## What is an object?

An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete 'thing' that is made using a class. An object has properties and methods. Almost everything in Python is an object, including strings, lists, dictionaries, and numbers.

When we create an object, we say that we are instantiating a class.


## What is a method?

A method is a function that is defined inside a class. It is used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects. Methods are essential in encapsulation concept of the OOP paradigm. This is essential in dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications.
